# Sign Language Recognition System

## About The Project
This Sign Language Recognition System is designed to translate sign language into text in real-time, making communication for the deaf and hard of hearing community more accessible. Using a dataset of 300 images for each gesture and machine learning technology, this system can recognize various signs and translate them into corresponding letters or words.

## Target Audience
The project is aimed at individuals, educators, and institutions within the deaf and hard of hearing community, aiming to facilitate smoother communication through technology. It's also an invaluable resource for developers and researchers working on assistive technologies.
